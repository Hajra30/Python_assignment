# **Statistics**
Collection of methods for collecting,displaying,analyzing and drawing conclusion from data.

## **language of statistics**

- _**Average**_ income in Pakistan
- **Highest** score in cricket match
- Fastest (**Maximum**) bowler
- 40% (**percentage**) Teachers in pakistan are females
- Weather forecast 
- Stock market
  
  

 ## **Data Types**
 1- Cross sectional and Time series

 2- Univariate and Multi variate
 
 ## **Variable types**
 1- Binomial and Multinomial

 2- Categorical (Nominal)

 - ordinal

 3- Ratio data 

 4- Interval variables/data

 ## **Measurment of Central tendencies**

 MEAN ,MEDIAN AND MODE 


## TESTS AND THEIR TYPES
### PARAMETRIC TESTS 
- More reliable results
- first we have to meet the assumptions

Column A | Column B | 
---------|----------|
 2|  25
 5|  38
16| 52

 Not equal !

 ### NON PARAMETRIC TESTS
 - less reliable
 - Callculate rank of the data
 - No need to make assumptions

Column A | Column B | 
---------|----------|
 1|  1
 2|  2
3| 3
Equal? on the base of ranking

### --- _Before starting the data  analysis_

## **Step 1  Normality Test**

If the bell curve on graph is normal means that data is normal .
Tests that are used most commonly are

- Shapiro-Wilk Test (more specific and reliable)
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (General and less reliablr)

## **Step 2 Homogeneity Test**

The variance of the variable in data are equal.

Tests that are used are 
- Levene Test
  
## **Step 3 Purpose**

know the purpose of your reserach question.
### _Two types Of purposes_

- comparison (difference)

e.g male vs Female

control vs disease group
- Relationship (connection)
  
  e.g Can food predict weight of group of indivisual
  
  Do Fertilizer application increase crop growth 

  
## **Step 4 Data TYpe**

Knowing type of data we are working with .

### TWO TYPES OF DATA:

1- Catagorical

- Qualitative
- no numerical meaning
- represented in text 
- e.g>charater,factor,yes or no 

2-Contineous

- Quantitave
- numerical
- mostly represented in numbers
- e.g>numerical variable,amount,no,plant height,age,fertilizer amount

## **Step 5 Statistical Tests**

choosing statistical test from three main families .these are 

- chi-squared

>purpose is comparison

>data is catagorical only

>can be use with any number of level 

>must remember purpose and data type 
- t-Test /Anova

>purpose is comparison 

>data iscategorical and cntineous

- Correlation

>purpose is frelationship

>data is contineous only 

>types include

        - pearson's correlation >shows how closly two values are 
        - Regression>shows specific methametical equationthat  decide relationship .


# Important things

- if data is following gaussian distribution ,that means data is normally distributed 
  
- data normalization methods are 
   
    - Log transformation
    - Min-max scalling
    - Z-score normalization
    - unit vector transformation
    - mean normalization
    - Box-cox normalization
  
# Anova 

3+level or groups are involved

1-1 way anova

    even on of the group is significant ,you will get significant results,but does not tell you which one .


2-Two way anova

    Two factor are envoloved

3-Repeated measures of anova 

    Three +paired groups are envolved 

# Anvoca

Analysis of co variance 
compare the means of three +independent groups which cannot be tested by anova because the variables are affected  by co-variance .

# Manova 

Multi - variate analysis of variance 

# Mancova

Multi variate analysis of CO - variance 

# **OTHER TESTS**

- Reliability tests
- Validity tests 
- Sample size computation 
- Inter rater reliability tests
